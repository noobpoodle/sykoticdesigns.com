Whether you already have a concept for your web project or you want a faster approach one of the three points discussed below will likely fit well to your needs and match your starting point for what may seem like a daunting task.  Depending upon the requirements, any option for beginning or continuing development should be customized to fit your needs. My goal is a happy client, not cookie cutter one for all packages -And I can prove it to you that no matter how you foresee launching web projects given any number of requirements, that you need a development process that matches your uniqueness as a business.<p style="line-height: 25px;">
<i style="font-style: normal;line-height: 25px;font-weight: 500;">Please NOTE: Depending upon the service desired I will gladly modify existing web templates or software programs. In some cases original design or development files will be needed. I have taken over many projects for web application design, development, ecommerce templating, and feature additions for clients who have a need that any other company or person could not provide, or to refine a particular link in the supply chain of existing web development companies. No project, idea, or relationship is out of reach. If you have a need, please contact me so we can discuss.<br>

<strong style="font-style: normal;font-weight: 500;">Some first thoughts for an average customer's needs, or My sincere request to hear yours</strong>
<p style="line-height: 25px;font-style: normal;">
If you are looking to create a bold web presence, a simple and light contract, verbal, or written agreement for web work may be what you've been waiting for.  Again I invite you to <span class="huget2" style="line-height: 25px;font-size: 14px;">contact</span> me right away, skip all the following plausible circumstances and let's get right down to what you want. But to explain and iterate; <br><br>Features designed and included for generally  would allow enough time to design, preview, and transfer fairly graphical layouts while keeping the cost low. I am a web developer today because of providing service at this level to clients. <br><br>Need a new logo, a new application feature, or a web site update? These types of work fall under that rubrick, and we can start with a simple agreement on what you would like to accomplish and previews to showcase which I can provide in person, over the phone,  by video chat, email or similar. <strong style="line-height: 25px;font-weight: 500;"><i style="font-style: normal;">Often my client relationships start with this level of service, contact me today and let's talk about any task you need to see through</i></strong>!<!-- p-->
</p><p style="line-height: 25px;font-style: normal;">I invite you to explain your needs to me in three words or less. If I have not covered what you feel your project requires then let's talk about how to define what it is you are looking for. I have taken on many projects at many different levels of availability and at many different periods of involvement in the execution of many different web development tasks, I challenge we can find a way to agree on what you're looking for and what you need in ways that can be explained to any level of management or to any number of related marketing and sales teams which interface with the technology at hand. I have examples I can show you right now of how I have trained teams on products I did not even create myself in ways that the developers failed to illustrate. Working together, we can roll out any feature or product launch with the right tools to service any level of your supply chain.</p></div>
<div class="rTableCell third">
<strong style="font-style: normal;font-weight: 500;">Secondary thoughts And when the target audience online is a buying one</strong>
<p style="font-style: normal;line-height: 25px;">
Those seeking a more graphically intensive template or who require a more complex layout, such as an online commerce driven web site will find their solution here.  Individuals and Small businesses will find this level of service more fitting to their needs, which may or may not require a contact between us, And ecommerce solutions such as a product catalogue or shopping cart may be provided on request, generally time inclusive for one product, or category of products ( as an example; As seen on tv web sites).

</li><li style="font-style: normal;">Javascript and CGI implementation to fit a variety of applications
  </li></ul><p style="line-height: 25px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 300;">
<strong><i style="font-style: normal;">Medium size company, And new launches for single product offerings fit well with these considerations</i></strong>
</p><p style="line-height: 25px;">And when the project requires using pre-existing technology, I can help you find a way to teach or integrate that technology smoothely into any other requirement or feature launch that we are working on. This is why I have kept my marketing focus over the years, using the right words to explain what we are trying to accomplish to a specific audience ultimately can make all the difference in it's success and in the success of the activity you are representing when trying to roll out that work for your business.</p>

<div class="rTableCell third">
<strong style="font-style: normal;font-weight: 500;">Continuing thoughts on; when the project demands feature rich content and options for your team</strong><p style="font-style: normal;line-height: 25px;">
Adding in options for managing pages, products, and the design itself will give you the ability to make use of ecommerce options, flash layouts, and more generally always be supported by a custom web application frame work such as Wordpress.  Medium/Large businesses will find adding features such as those below more fitting to their needs.  Having needs to expand and maintain an extensible code base by your ownw web team may be considerations we reach at this level, and this would almost always require a contract to be agreed upon. Please note that third party solutions may incur additional costs, this solution will allow for a store front, a product catalogue, or an online boutique and may make use of thousands of dynamically generated pages and links for purchase.
</p><p style="font-style: normal;line-height: 25px;">Make use of: 
</p><li style="font-style: normal;">any number of pages, domains and links<br>
</li><li style="font-style: normal;">any number of template designs (Illustrator etc)<br>
</li><li style="font-style: normal;">any number of logos, branding etc<br>
</li><li style="font-style: normal;">a custom or Wordpress based application framework<br>
</li><li style="font-style: normal;">ecommerce setup and maintenance<br>
</li><li style="font-style: normal;">ecommerce and CMS training<p>
<strong><i style="font-weight: 500;font-style: normal;line-height: 25px;">Corporate web design often finds it's needs here, no matter the existing company size</i></strong>

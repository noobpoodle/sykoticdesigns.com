My code base for my sole proprietorship, a code company registered with the State of Pennsylvania. Please read my DISCLAIMER on this repo. 



I will summarize here: Extensibility is defined currently by google with a top result describing an "architecture" that is "designed to accommodate changes". Github provides me with this in it's most core form. This is why I have chosen to load a number of websites' code bases here, and online, as a primary benefit. Versioning and backing up for these web sites is, as opposed to an application, or a code snippet, a must. I am unconcerned with the morality in using this account for those purposes, as in those cases I am the  one making commits and using prior or updated versions, mostly. In this regard it is important for me to have an extensible code base, but more important for my storage of static web content and designs to be kept structurally sound in at least one way that makes use of the cloud and removes the possibility of inactivity as being any cause of lost data. What that means is, Github is a great way to store and reference code! 



And so my DISCLAIMER is in place to reference how I license this web site, this README serves to reference why, And I am glad the structure for my "final" design is kept in place using the most popular in versioning software. I would gather if you've read this far you may wish to know a little more about the files stored. And so I can think of only one metric that could always be used to refer to a static, dynamic, web site or application in it's entirety or any change, update, modification, or code fix contained, and that is the time required. In about half of those examples the time required to fix and commit an update or a fix would be self serving. So I provide here an estimation of the time required for development or in theming of any domain theme being referenced.


I spent approximately (3) three hours theming the graphical layout used here, and about as much time in templating my final design.

My code base for my sole proprietorship, a code company registered with the State of Pennsylvania. Please read my DISCLAIMER on this repo. 



I will summarize here: Extensibility is defined currently by google with a top result describing an "architecture" that is "designed to accommodate changes". Github provides me with this in it's most core form. This is why I have chosen to load a number of websites' code bases here, and online, as a primary benefit. Versioning and backing up for these web sites is, as opposed to an application, or a code snippet, a must. I am unconcerned with the morality in using this account for those purposes, as in those cases I am the  one making commits and using prior or updated versions, mostly. In this regard it is important for me to have an extensible code base, but more important for my storage of static web content and designs to be kept structurally sound in at least one way that makes use of the cloud and removes the possibility of inactivity as being any cause of lost data. What that means is, Github is a great way to store and reference code!
